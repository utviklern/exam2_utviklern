## Brief
A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to
develop a brand new
front-end for their application. While they have a list of required
features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official
API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front-end accommodation booking
application.
There are two aspects to this brief:
the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue,
and
an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and
bookings at those venues.

## Terminology
Visitor – a user who has not registered or logged in.
Customer – a user who has registered and logged in as a customer.
Venue Manager – a user who has registered and logged in as a Venue Manager.

## User Stories
All users:
May view a list of Venues.
May search for a specific Venue.
May view a specific Venue page by id.
May register as a customer with a stud.noroff.no email address and password.
May register as a Venue Manager with a stud.noroff.no email address and password.
May view a calendar with available dates for a Venue. Should dates be booked this
must be indicated within the calendar.

## Customers:
May login and log out once registered.
May create a booking at a Venue.
May view their upcoming bookings.
May update their avatar/profile picture (a placeholder avatar/profile picture may be
provided as a default until the customer updates it).

## Venue Managers:
May login and log out once registered.
May create a Venue.
May edit/update a Venue they manage.
May delete a Venue they manage.
May view upcoming bookings made at a Venue they manage.
May update their avatar/profile picture (a placeholder avatar/profile picture may be
provided as a default until the Venue Manager updates it).

## Resources

links below to inform your development process:

## Process
1. Create a GitHub repository where you
will commit and deploy your code.

2. Create a Kanban plan for your project using GitHub Projects or Trello. Note if you
decide to use GitHub projects for your Gannt Chart that your project must include a
Roadmap View.

3. Create a Style Guide using Figma. The style guide must include the logo, font pairings,
color palette that includes primary and secondary colors as well as common
components used throughout the web application.

4. Create a prototype in Figma for desktop and mobile screen sizes. The prototype does
not need to be interactive and should be used to test out different layouts. You are
allowed to make changes to your delivered project from the prototype.

5. Use your plan and design documents to complete the user stories, committing your
code frequently. Make sure all your final work has been merged into the main or
master branch.

6. Write a descriptive README.md that describes your project thoroughly, including how
to setup and run the project locally.

7. Manually test each user story to ensure that it is completed.

8. Test the web application with online tools such as the HTM
Markup Validation Tool,Lighthouse and WAVE.

9. Deploy your project using a static hosting platform such as GitHub Pages or Netlify.

10. Deliver the required links to your work
